WINDOWS:

The included hpzip.vcproj file is a Visual Studio project that allows
the compilation of the program in a Windows environment.

The GSL library is needed to compile the project. The included project
files assume that the library files are located in 
C:\Program Files\GnuWin32\lib and the include files are in 
C:\Program Files\GnuWin32\include (those are the default installation
directories for the Windows GSL library)

The project include debug and release settings, in addition to the
optimizations and debug symbols the debug settings define the DEBUG
preprocessor variable.


UNIX:

The included Makefile can be used to compile the project in a GNU
environment. This file creates two executable files: hpzip and
hpzip.opt. The first one is the debug version and the second is the
optimized version. The debug version defines the DEBUG preprocessor 
variable.

In addition to those files, two links to them are created called
hpunzip and hpunzip.opt. These can be used to decompress files without
the needing to specify any command line options.

The GSL library is needed for compilation. It must be located in any
of the default library directories. If this is not so the appropriate
environment variables should be adjusted (i.e. LD_LIBRARY_PATH, etc.)

This makefile can also be used to generate the program
documentation. To do so the command "make doc" must be executed. For it
to work the the doxygen documentation utility must be installed in the
system. 

To clean the object code files created during compulation "make clean"
must be executed. Furthermore the "make doc-clean" command deletes all
the generated documentation.


ARITHMETIC ENCODER:

source code as taken from
