This is an implementation of the semi predictive coding algoritm of
[1].


SOURCE CODE:

All the source code files for the encoder, except the arithmetic
encoder/decoder are in this same directory. The arithmetic encoder
code is in the "arithmetic" directory, and the documentation is in the
"doc" directory.

For information about compilating this code see the INSTALL file.


DOCUMENTATION:

Inside the doc directory there are two subdirectories. In html there
is the HTML version of the manual. In the latex directory there is the
PDF version of the manual. If the documentation is generated again
(see INSTALL file) the latex directory will contain the latex source
files that allow the creation of the documentation file in PDF
format. To do so the command "make" must be executed in this
directory.


USAGE:

hpzip [options] input_file [output_file]
hpunzip [options] input_file [output_file]

Options:
        -z: compress (default)
        -d: decompress (default if invoked as hpunzip)
        -b: binarize file (needed for compression and decompression)
        -h: show this message

Options for compression only:
        -k: use Kurtz algorithm (default)
        -u: use Ukkonnen algorithm (default with -b)

When the file is invoked as "hpzip" compression is the default
action. When invoked as "hpunzip" decompression is the default.

The default output_file for compression is input_file.hpz. When
decompressing the default output file is the input file with the
extension removed. If the input file does not has an extension the
default output file wil be input_file.out

The -k and -u options select the algorithm that will be used to build
the context tree of the input string.
